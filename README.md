App Quran for Android
In the application, a list of all surahs is loaded on the home page. Each of which, you can read or view detailed information about the surah. Each verse that makes up the surah can be copied, shared, bookmarked, watch a video if it is available, read the comments, or offer your version of the translation, which will be sent to my email address.
The settings page implements:
- changing the font size of the text of surahs and verses;
- changing text alignment on the left/right edge;
- button to clear all bookmarks;
- changing the language of the application;
- the ability to leave feedback or report a problem that exists in the application, which will be sent to my email address;
- willingness to distribute the application
